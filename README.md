reloz
=====
A Chrome extension to re-color and modify JIRAÂ® status lozenges.

A list of unresolved issues can sometimes be an overwhelming wall of yellow lozenges.  This browser extension watches 
for the "Blocked" status and styles it red.

Setup
-----
This requires no changes to the server or project settings.  You might wish to lock down the URL permissions/matches of
 this extension to the path of your local JIRA installation(s); to do so modify `manifest.json` lines 10, 11, and 16.

Background
----------
Behind the scenes this extension leverages DOM Mutation observation using Google's [Mutation Summary library][1].  It 
will iterate over every `jira-issue-status-lozenge` it encounters and checks the text to decide what to do. This is
rather heavy-handed and there is a slight delay when the page loads before the re-coloring occurs.  If you are looking
at thousands of lozenges on a single page you might start having problems.

To keep things relatively quick this code relies on JIRA's built-in lozenge color styles documented in the [Atlassian 
Design Guidelines][3].  It wouldn't be difficult to modify this code to add completely custom color classes if needed.

Future
------
While in the short term this could easily be extended to support multiple, configurable statuses and color combinations 
for more complex projects, a more sustainable solution would be to add your vote to [JRA-36241][2]!
